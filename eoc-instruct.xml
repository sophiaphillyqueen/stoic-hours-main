If this is your last Hour you plan to follow today, the now is a good time for the
Examination of Conscience.
</instruct>
<instruct>
Also do this if it is the first Hour you are following today you forgot to do
yesterday's Examination of Conscience - now is a good time to do that, as it is
better late than never.
</instruct>
<instruct>
Examination of Conscience can be done in the form of a journal - but that
is not the only way to do it.
You can do it mentally -- as long as you can make sure, without any external
actions, that you are in fact doing it.
Also - for practice sake, it can be done in dialogue with a mentor.
But doing it with a mentor
is only recommended for practice sake - and may not even be available to everyone
at all.
</instruct>
<instruct>
Above all -- remember that the Examination of Conscience done here is the
Stoic version of the concept and none other.
